Enter the Ultratech room by using the following link: https://tryhackme.com/r/room/basicpentestingjt

Read the instruction of the mission and start the target machine using the start machine icon on the top right.
By clicking on ? icon you can download Openvpn configuration file which helps you in connecting and accessing into targets VPN connection.
From here we can get target IP : 10.10.252.28 and Title : Web App Test

Perform nmap scan to observe open ports and services.
sudo nmap -Pn -n -p- 10.10.252.28 --min-rate 5000

1.3 What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?
By performing dirbuster scan on port 80 ( Apache) shows the hidden directories and files
sudo dirb http://10.10.252.28
By doing the above process "d*********t" is found as a hidden directory.

Taking advantage of port 445 (SMB). Try to find the shares present with target machine.
smbmap -H 10.10.252.28 - to see the shares
smbclient //10.10.252.28/<sharename> - to read or enter the shares
From a share named Anonymous. There's a hidden file staff.txt where it shows a message from kay to jan ( we can consider the followings names as usernames.)

Perform brute forcing to find password.
Now, let's do brute forcing the ssh logins using usernames as jan& kay and password list as rockyou.txt
hydra -L userlist.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.252.28

Yes! it's correct we cracked a user credentials its jan:a******

Now let's dig deeper. After searching for any files in the directories, we found keys of user kay at /home/kay/.ssh/ location.

Here we can think of accessing kay using private key. Let's make a copy of private key id_rsa on our host machine and try logging into kay.
ssh -i kay_id_rsa kay@10.10.252.28

Here's the new challenge, there's a passphrase protected to the key.

It's time to use ssh2john which converts ssh keys into hash format that johntheripper can understand.

ssh2john kay_id_rsa > kaykey
john kaykey

Yup! we got passphrase its "b*****x".

Let's enter kay now. We can see a pass.bak file in /home/kay directory which contains kay's password its "h******************************************************$$"
