 Ultratech-latest 
Step -1: Enter the Ultratech room by using the following link: https://tryhackme.com/r/room/ultratech1 

Task -1 
Deploy the machine 

Read the instruction of the mission and start the target machine using the start machine buttonon the top right. 
By clicking on ? icon you can download Openvpn configuration file which helps you in connecting and accessing into targets VPN connection. 
From here we can get target IP: 10.10.85.42 and Title: Ultratech-latest 

Task -2 
It's enumeration time! 

Perform nmap scan on the target which helps to find all the open ports and services running. 
sudo nmap 10.10.85.42 -Pn -n -p- -sV --min-rate 5000 

2.1 Which software is using the port 8081? 
With the above scan it is clearly mention that N***.** software is using port 8081. 
2.2 Which other non-standard port is used? 
Non-standard port means using a customized port which is not well-known here port ***** is non-standard port. 
2.3 Which software using this port? 
From the same it is mentioned that A****** software is using 31331 port. 
2.4 Which GNU/Linux distribution seems to be used? 
It is mentioned in the scan that Linux distribution used is U***** 
2.5 The software using the port 8081 is a REST api, how many of its routes are used by the web application? 
From the below view source there are * routes for web application. 

Task - 3 
Let the fun begin 

Let's run dirbuster scan on port 8081 sudo dirb http://10.10.85.42:31331 we found robots.txt as a file in the above location, from where we can find a new file "utech_sitemap.txt".
When we go deeper in to the file "/partners.html" is a html file with some interesting information. 
Entering into the .html file we can see a login page, see the view source page, you can find a new file "js/api.js" which shows a famous command injection vulnerability with ping. 

Now try, http://10.10.85.42:8081/ping?ip=example.com 
Now, let's try by adding two commands http://10.10.85.42:8081/ping?ip=example.com; 'ls' 
Here welcome the new file name "utech.db.sqlite". Let's cat the content of the file. 
Hurrah, we found 2 usernames and their password hashes. Let's keep them because we have ssh port open we can try getting remote connection. 

3.1 There is a database lying around, what is its filename? 
From the above finding the database lying is "u****.**.*****e". 
3.2 What is the first user's password hash? 
The first user mentioned is r00t with hash "f******************************2" 
3.3 What is the password associated with this hash? 
By cracking the above hash using crackstation we got "n******" as password. 

Task - 4 
The root of all evil* 

4.1 What are the first 9 characters of the root user's private SSH key? 
Let's use the above credentials and get remote connection. 
ssh r00t@10.10.85.42; password: n100906 
By executing command "id" showed a brilliant thing. 
User r00t belongs to docker group. Which helps in mounting and reading the host system root files. 
Firstly, lets use GTFOBins and see docker. 
from here we got a command to get docker root shell. Let's replace the image name "alpine" with our existing image file. 
Run 'docker ps -a' to list all the existing images in docker. 
Now, letâ€™s change the shell command a little bit: 
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh 
Hurrah! we got root shell. Let's now answer the question. Find the file id_rsa to get the private key. 
The first 9 letters of the private key is "M******B".
